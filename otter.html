    <p>Otters are sleek, playful mammals known for their intelligence, agility, and love of water. 
      Depending on the species, they can be found in a variety of habitats—river otters thrive in 
      freshwater environments like rivers and lakes, while sea otters make their homes along coastal marine shorelines, 
      especially in the northern Pacific Ocean.
      These clever carnivores have a varied diet that includes fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. 
      Sea otters, in particular, are known for their incredible ability to use tools—they often use rocks to crack open
      the hard shells of clams and sea urchins, resting the shellfish on their bellies as they float on their backs. 
      It is one of the clearest examples of tool use in the animal kingdom!
      Otters are highly social animals, especially sea otters, who often float together in large groups called “rafts.” 
      To keep from drifting apart in the current, sea otters will hold hands while they nap—a heart-melting behavior that has made them beloved around the world.
      Covered in thick, water-resistant fur, otters stay warm in chilly water without the need for a layer of fat like many marine mammals. 
      They are agile swimmers, using their webbed feet and powerful tails to dart through the water with ease.
      Otters are also incredibly playful—chasing one another, sliding down mud banks or snow, and playing with objects just for fun. 
      This playfulness, along with their intelligence and strong family bonds, makes otters one of the most charismatic animals in the wild.</p>
